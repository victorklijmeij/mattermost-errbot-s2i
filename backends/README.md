# Errbot Backend for Mattermost

### REQUIREMENTS
- Mattermost with APIv4
- Python >= 3.4
- websockets 3.2
- [mattermostdriver](https://github.com/Vaelor/python-mattermost-driver) > 4.0

### INSTALLATION

- `git clone https://github.com/Vaelor/errbot-mattermost-backend.git`
- Create an account for the bot on the server.
- Install the requirements.
- Open errbot's config.py:

```
BACKEND = 'Mattermost'
BOT_EXTRA_BACKEND_DIR = '/path/to/backends'

BOT_ADMINS = ('@yourname') # Names need the @ in front!

BOT_IDENTITY = {
        # Required
        'team': 'nameoftheteam',
        'server': 'mattermost.server.com',
        # For the login, either
        'login': 'bot@email.de',
        'password': 'botpassword',
        # Or, if you have a personal access token
        'token': 'YourPersonalAccessToken',
        # Optional
        'insecure': False, # Default = False. Set to true for self signed certificates
        'scheme': 'https', # Default = https
        'port': 8065, # Default = 8065
        'timeout': 30, # Default = 30. If the webserver disconnects idle connections later/earlier change this value
        'cards_hook': 'incomingWebhookId' # Needed for cards/attachments
}
```

- If the bot has problems doing some actions, you should make it system admin, some actions won't work otherwise.

### Cards/Attachments
Cards are called attachments in Mattermost.
If you want to send attachments, you need to create an incoming Webhook in Mattermost
and add the webhook id to your errbot `config.py` in `BOT_IDENTITY`.
This is not an ideal solution, but AFAIK Mattermost does not support sending attachments
over the api like slack does.

### APIv3
Use the APIv3 branch for that. It is no longer supported and not guaranteed to work!

**Attention**: The `BOT_IDENTITY` config options are different for V3 and V4!

### KNOWN (POSSIBLE) ISSUES

- Channelmentions in messages aren't accounted for (Unsure if they need to be)

### FAQ

##### The Bot does not answer my direct messages
If you have multiple teams, check that you are both members of the same team!

# SPECIAL THANKS

**Thanks** to http://errbot.io and all the contributors to the bot.
Most of this code was build with help from the already existing backends,
especially:
